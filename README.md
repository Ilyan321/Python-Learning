# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is where I’m documenting my progress as I learn Python from the ground up. It’s a space for me to track my milestones, store my weekly projects, and see how far I’ve come as a developer.

## 📅 The Weekly Breakdown

### 📁 Week 1: The Fundamentals 🏗️
This week was all about building a solid foundation. I focused on basic syntax, conditional statements (if-else), and mastering loops.
* **Digital Wallet Project:** A tool to manage expenses using Python lists.
* **Random Guessing Game:** A game using the random module to challenge the user.
* **Interactive Calculator:** A basic arithmetic tool with a clean exit logic.
* **Concepts Mastered:** User input handling, type conversion, while loops, and list manipulation.

### 📁 Week 2: Leveling Up 🚀
This week, I focused on advanced logic, matrix operations, and building more complex interactive programs.
* **Mega Project 1 (Prime Finder):** Identifies all prime numbers within a user-defined range.
* **Mega Project 2 (Matrix Maniupulation):** Handles 2D lists to calculate sums for both rows and columns.
* **Mega Project 3 (Number Guessing 2.0):** An interactive game featuring a scoring system and round management.
* **To-Do List App:** A CLI application to add, view, and clear tasks efficiently.
* **Concepts Mastered:** Nested loops, 2D list indexing, and library integration (random).
