🐍 My Python Learning Journey
Welcome! This repository is where I’m documenting my progress as I learn Python from the ground up. It’s a space for me to track my milestones, store my weekly projects, and see how far I’ve come as a developer.

📅 The Weekly Breakdown
📁 Week 1: The Fundamentals 🏗️
This week was all about building a solid foundation. I focused on basic syntax, conditional statements (if-else), and mastering loops.

Digital Wallet Project: A tool to manage expenses using Python lists.

Random Guessing Game: A game using the random module to challenge the user.

Interactive Calculator: A basic arithmetic tool with a clean exit logic.

Concepts Mastered: User input handling, type conversion, while loops, and list manipulation.

📁 Week 2: Leveling Up 🚀
Current Status: In Progress. I’ve just created this folder and am getting ready to push my new programs as I dive deeper into more intermediate Python concepts.

🛠️ How to Explore
Navigate into the Week folders to see the specific .py scripts.

You can also find screenshots of the code and their terminal outputs to see the programs in action.
