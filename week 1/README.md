# Python Fundamentals: Week 1 Projects 🐍

Welcome to my journey into Python development! This repository contains the projects I built during my first week of the PITP Python course. My focus was on mastering logic, user interaction, and data management.

## 🚀 Projects Included

1. Digital Wallet 💰
My favorite project so far. A terminal-based application that allows users to:
* Add income/amounts with specific reasons.
* Store data dynamically using Python lists.
* View total balance and a history of transactions.

2. Random Number Guessing Game 🎮
A fun interactive game utilizing the `random` library.
* Implements `while` loops for continuous play.
* Provides "higher" or "lower" feedback to the user.
* Tracks the number of attempts taken to win.

3. Interactive Calculator 🧮
A clean, functional calculator for everyday arithmetic.
* Handles Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* Features a custom 'exit' command to break the loop gracefully.

🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
* **Control Flow:** Mastering `if-elif-else` structures.
* **Iteration:** Using `while True` loops for persistent terminal apps.
* **Data Structures:** Implementing `lists` to store and retrieve user data.
* **Built-in Functions:** Leveraging `int()`, `input()`, `sum()`, and the `random` module.
