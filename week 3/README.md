Python Programming: Logic & Mega Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed during Week 3 of my Python learning journey. These projects range from fundamental algorithmic implementations to menu-driven systems using advanced data structures and error handling.

🚀 Projects Overview
1. Contact Management System (Mega Project 1 & 5)
A full-featured, menu-driven application to manage personal contacts using Python dictionaries.


Features: Add, search, update, and delete contacts .


Data Storage: Uses nested dictionaries to store multiple attributes like phone numbers and emails for each unique name.


Input Validation: Prevents duplicate entries by checking if a contact already exists before adding .

2. Robust Division Calculator (Mega Project 2)
A program designed to perform division while gracefully handling potential runtime crashes .


Error Handling: Implements try-except blocks to catch ZeroDivisionError and ValueError (for non-numeric inputs) .


Logic: Uses float conversion to ensure precision in division results .

3. Data Structure Operations (Mega Project 3 & 4)
A deep dive into Python's built-in data structures to perform statistical and organizational tasks.


Tuple Operations: A function that accepts a tuple and returns the maximum, minimum, and total sum simultaneously .


List Manipulation: Demonstrates the use of .sort() and .reverse() methods to organize numerical data in descending order .

4. Simple Banking System
A simulation of a banking environment focusing on global state management.

Features: Check balance, deposit funds, and withdraw funds with real-time balance updates.

Concepts: Utilization of the global keyword to manage the amount variable across multiple functional scopes.

5. Advanced Menu-Driven Calculator (Assignment Day 5)
An interactive calculator that persists until the user chooses to exit.


Operational Checks: Uses membership testing (not in) to validate if a user-selected operator is supported .


Nested Handling: Features nested try-except blocks specifically for division operations within a broader calculation loop .

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
Error & Exception Handling: Mastery of try, except, else, and finally blocks.

Functional Programming: Use of inner/outer functions, lambda expressions, and recursion for Factorials and Fibonacci sequences.


Logic Flow: Implementation of persistent while True loops for user-centric interfaces.
