Python Learning Journey: Week 2 Mega Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and projects developed during my second week of learning Python. These projects focus on core programming concepts including loops (for, while), list manipulation, and matrix operations.

🚀 Projects Included
1. Mega Project 1: Prime Number Finder
A program that takes a numerical range from the user and identifies all prime numbers within that range.


File: Mega_Project_2.py (and class_5_Project_1.py) 


Key Concepts: Nested loops, conditional logic, and range handling.

2. Mega Project 2: Matrix Manipulation
This script demonstrates how to handle 2D lists (matrices) by calculating sums for both rows and columns.


File: Mega_Project_2.py 

Functionality:

Prints each row of a 3×3 matrix.

Calculates and prints the sum of each individual row.

Calculates and prints the total sum for each of the three columns.

3. Mega Project 3: Number Guessing Game
An interactive game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.


File: Mega_Project_3.py 

Features:


Scoring System: Gain 10 points for every correct guess.


Round Management: Play multiple rounds with 3 attempts per round.


Randomization: Uses the random library for game logic.

📂 Additional Learning Exercises
Aside from the mega projects, this repository includes several practice scripts:

To-Do List App: A simple CLI application to add, view, and clear tasks.

List Operations: Scripts finding maximum/minimum values and reversing lists using for loops.

Loop Basics: Exercises covering break, continue, and iterating over strings and lists.

Timers: Countdown programs and logic to skip specific numbers (like divisibles of 3).

🛠️ How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can run any project by navigating to the directory and using:

Bash
python <filename>.py
