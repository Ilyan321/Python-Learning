# Python Learning Journey: Week 2 Mega Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and projects developed during my second week of learning Python. These projects focus on core programming concepts including **loops (for, while)**, **list manipulation**, and **matrix operations**.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. Mega Project 1: Prime Number Finder
A program that takes a numerical range from the user and identifies all prime numbers within that range.
* **File:** `class_5_Project_1.py`
* **Key Concepts:** Nested loops, conditional logic, and range handling.

### 2. Mega Project 2: Matrix Manipulation
This script demonstrates how to handle 2D lists (matrices) by calculating sums for both rows and columns.
* **File:** `Mega_Project_2.py`
* **Functionality:**
    * Prints each row of a 3x3 matrix.
    * Calculates and prints the sum of each individual row.
    * Calculates and prints the total sum for each of the three columns.

### 3. Mega Project 3: Number Guessing Game
An interactive game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.
* **File:** `Mega_Project_3.py`
* **Features:**
    * **Scoring System:** Gain 10 points for every correct guess.
    * **Round Management:** Play multiple rounds with 3 attempts per round.
    * **Randomization:** Uses the `random` library for game logic.

## 📂 Additional Learning Exercises

Aside from the mega projects, this repository includes several practice scripts:
* **To-Do List App:** A CLI application to add, view, and clear tasks.
* **Max/Min Values:** Scripts finding maximum and minimum values in a list.
* **Reverse List:** Reversing a list using a `for` loop.
* **Loop Basics:** Exercises covering `break`, `continue`, and iterating over strings.
* **Timers:** Countdown programs and logic to skip specific numbers.

## 🛠️ How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can run any project by navigating to the directory and using:

```bash
python <filename>.py
